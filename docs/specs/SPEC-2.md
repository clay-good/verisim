# Verisim — v0 Engineering & Experiment Specification (SPEC-2.md)

> The buildable companion to [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md). SPEC.md is the science (why, what we claim, how we'd know we're wrong). **This document is the build**: the exact v0 environment, oracle, model, metrics, baselines, repo layout, tech stack, reproducibility regime, and milestone plan. It is written so that someone (the author, a collaborator, or a coding agent) can start implementing immediately and so that every experiment that produces a figure in the paper is fully specified here first.
>
> **After v0:** [SPEC-3.md](./SPEC-3.md) is the depth expansion (the real system oracle, network/multi-host state, partial observability, the self-healing online-adaptation loop, the information-theoretic bits-to-correct metric, and the SOTA lessons), and [SPEC-4.md](./SPEC-4.md) is the Autonomous Research Engine that drives the whole program with the human out of the loop. The v0 autoresearch ratchet specified at §17.5 is the seed of SPEC-4.

**License:** MIT. **Scope of this doc:** Phase 0 (v0) only — see SPEC.md §12 for later phases. **Prime directive:** *the only job of v0 is to plot `H_ε(ρ)` once, cleanly, and test H1–H3.* Everything below serves that and refuses scope creep.

---

## 1. v0 scope: the smallest world with the hard property

The "hard property" of world models is **compounding state**: a mistake early in a rollout poisons everything after it, because state created (or destroyed) at step *t* must remain consistent at step *t+50*. The smallest environment that exhibits this — while being fully observable, deterministic, serializable, resettable, and unmistakably a *computer* world — is a **constrained shell over an in-memory filesystem**.

v0 is exactly that and nothing more. No networking, no real processes, no partial observability, no concurrency. Those are later phases and must not leak into v0.

**v0 deliverable:** the `H_ε(ρ)` curve (H1), the consultation-policy comparison (H2), the correction-operator comparison (H3), reproducibly, with figures, on this one environment family. Optionally a short technical report. That's the whole of v0.

---

## 2. The environment: a deterministic shell + filesystem world

### 2.1 State `S`

A state is a fully serializable snapshot:

```
State = {
  fs:   map[path -> Node]          # the filesystem tree
  cwd:  path                       # current working directory
  env:  map[str -> str]            # environment variables (small, fixed keyset)
  last: { exit_code: int, stdout_hash: hash }   # result of the last action (observation)
}
Node = File{ mode: int, content_hash: hash, size: int }
     | Dir { mode: int }
```

- Paths are POSIX-style absolute paths. Content is stored content-addressably (a hash → bytes store) so states are cheap to diff and compare; equality of two files is equality of `content_hash`.
- The state is **canonicalizable**: there is one and only one serialized form (sorted paths, normalized modes), so two semantically equal states serialize identically. This is essential for the divergence metric and for exact-match scoring.

### 2.2 Action `A` (the command grammar)

A fixed, small, unambiguous grammar of shell commands. v0 keyset (extend only with cause):

```
mkdir <path>            rm <path>              rmdir <path>
touch <path>            rm -r <path>           mv <src> <dst>
write <path> <token>    cp <src> <dst>         cp -r <src> <dst>
append <path> <token>   chmod <mode> <path>    cd <path>
cat <path>              ls <path>              export <KEY>=<token>
```

- `<token>` is drawn from a small fixed vocabulary of content tokens (so content space is finite and learnable; v0 is about *structure and consequence*, not arbitrary byte modeling).
- Every command has fully specified semantics, including failure modes (e.g., `rmdir` on a non-empty dir fails with a defined exit code and leaves state unchanged; `mv` of a dir moves the whole subtree; `rm -r` cascades). The failure cases are where compounding error bites and must be modeled exactly.
- Actions are emitted by a **driver** (a stochastic policy over the grammar; see §4) — *not* by a learned agent in v0. v0 studies the world model, not an agent.

### 2.3 Transition semantics

The semantics are defined once, in the **reference oracle** (§3), as a deterministic function `O(state, action) -> state'`. The semantics doc (`docs/semantics.md`, to be written alongside the implementation) is the normative English description; the oracle code is the executable truth. Any disagreement is a bug in one of them and is resolved by test (§16).

### 2.4 Making drift real (anti-triviality)

If the world is too simple, the neural model never drifts and there is no curve (SPEC.md §13 risk). v0 deliberately includes drift-inducing structure, and the environment has a **difficulty dial**:

- **Long-range dependencies:** files created early must persist and be referenced late; `mv`/`rm -r` on deep subtrees force the model to track structure it saw many steps ago.
- **Branching consequences:** the same command has different effects depending on accumulated state (e.g., `rmdir` succeeds or fails depending on whether earlier steps emptied the dir).
- **Difficulty parameters** (config): max tree depth, breadth, fraction of destructive/cascading commands, rollout length. Sweep these until the pure-neural model (`ρ=0`) drifts within the horizons we test — that's the regime where the science lives.

---

## 3. The oracle `O`

### 3.1 v0 oracle: deterministic reference interpreter

v0 uses a **reference oracle**: a from-scratch, deterministic Python implementation of the §2.3 semantics. Properties it must guarantee:

- **Determinism:** `O(s, a)` depends only on `(s, a)`. No clock, no RNG, no environment leakage. (Any pseudo-randomness in driver/policy lives in the driver, not the oracle.)
- **Totality:** defined for every `(s, a)`, including all failures; failures return a well-defined `(state unchanged or partially changed per real semantics, exit_code, stdout)`.
- **Purity / snapshotability:** `O` does not mutate its input state; it returns a new state. States are cheap to snapshot, hash, and restore.
- **Speed:** fast enough to generate large trajectory datasets and to serve as the in-loop verifier at `ρ=1` for the ceiling baseline.

The reference oracle *is* the symbolic half of the neuro-symbolic system (SPEC.md §6). It is honest about being a model of POSIX, not POSIX.

### 3.2 Interface (so the system oracle can drop in later)

Define one interface now so Phase 1's real-sandbox oracle is a drop-in (this is the only forward-looking abstraction v0 builds — justified because it costs one trait and saves a rewrite):

```python
class Oracle(Protocol):
    def step(self, state: State, action: Action) -> StepResult: ...   # true next state + observation
    def reset(self, state: State) -> None: ...                        # restore to a snapshot
    def determinism_report(self) -> DeterminismReport: ...            # which nondeterminism sources are sealed
```

v0 ships `ReferenceOracle`. Phase 1 ships `SandboxOracle` (namespaced shell / pinned container) behind the same interface. Nothing else in the codebase knows which oracle it's talking to.

---

## 4. Data: trajectory generation

- **Driver policies** (over the §2.2 grammar) generate `(state, action, next_state)` triples by rolling the oracle forward:
  - `uniform` — uniform over valid commands;
  - `weighted` — tilted toward structure-building then structure-mutating (produces realistic long-range dependencies);
  - `adversarial` — biased toward the drift-inducing/cascading commands (§2.4), used to stress-test.
- **Trajectory record (JSONL, one rollout per file):**
  ```
  { "env_config_hash": ..., "seed": ..., "driver": "...",
    "steps": [ { "state": <canonical>, "action": <str>, "next_state": <canonical>,
                 "delta": <structured edits>, "observation": {...} }, ... ] }
  ```
- **Splits:** train / val / test by *trajectory* (never leak a trajectory across splits). A separate **interventional/counterfactual** test set (Phase 3, but schema reserved now): pairs of rollouts identical up to step *t*, differing in action at *t*, with oracle-generated divergent continuations.
- **Dataset versioning:** every dataset carries the env-config hash, oracle version, driver, and seed, so any dataset is regenerable from its manifest (mirrors the author's existing content-hash/manifest discipline in `enklayve`/`vaulytica`).

---

## 5. The neural world model `M_θ`

### 5.1 Prediction target: structured state delta

`M_θ` predicts a **structured delta** `Δ̂` — the set of edits the action makes — *not* a regenerated full state. Rationale in SPEC.md §6.1 (bounds hallucination surface, localizes verification, more learnable). A delta is a sequence of typed edit ops:

```
Delta = [ Edit ]
Edit  = Create(path, node) | Delete(path) | Modify(path, new_content_token)
      | Move(src, dst) | Chmod(path, mode) | SetCwd(path) | SetEnv(key, token)
      | SetResult(exit_code, stdout_token)
```

`apply(state, Δ̂) -> state'` is a pure function (shared with the oracle's own apply step, so prediction and truth use identical application semantics — only the *deltas* are compared/produced differently).

### 5.2 Representation and model

- **Serialization:** state and action are serialized to a canonical token sequence (a compact DSL over paths, node types, modes, content tokens). Paths use a subword/segment tokenizer over the path alphabet; content uses the fixed content-token vocabulary (§2.2).
- **Model:** a small **decoder-only transformer** trained **from scratch** to map `serialize(state) ++ serialize(action) -> serialize(Δ̂)`. From-scratch is deliberate: it is small enough to train on the author's single local GPU, and building it doubles as the author's transformer-internals learning goal (nanoGPT lineage). A pretrained small code model is an allowed alternative baseline, not the primary.
- **Sizes:** start tiny (a few M params) and scale only as needed to make the *clean* (`ρ=0`) curve interesting; model size is an ablation axis, not a goal.
- **Output decoding:** constrained decoding to the `Delta` grammar (the model cannot emit a syntactically invalid edit). Note: grammar-validity ≠ semantic faithfulness — a syntactically valid delta can still be *wrong*; catching wrongness is the oracle's job, not the decoder's. This distinction is the whole point and must be kept crisp in code and writing.

### 5.3 Training objectives

- **Stage 1 — supervised next-delta prediction** on oracle-generated trajectories (teacher-forced). Loss over the serialized delta tokens.
- **Stage 2 (ablation / RQ via H-tests) — RLVR fine-tuning. ✅ Machinery shipped.** Roll the model out, reward = faithful horizon under the divergence metric (oracle as the verifiable reward; SPEC.md §6.3). This is where "train against the oracle" is realized. Kept as a clearly-scoped second stage so v0's first result doesn't depend on getting RL working. *Implemented:* `src/verisim/train/rlvr.py` — `sample_delta_with_logprob` (grammar-constrained *sampling* with a grad-tracking summed log-prob, sharing the greedy decoder's termination caps) and `train_rlvr` (vanilla REINFORCE with a moving-average baseline) optimizing the `verisim.rl.WorldModelEnv` episode return, which *is* `H_ε` (§15). *Verified by* `tests/test_rlvr.py`: deterministic given a seed, samples are always grammar-valid, the gradient flows, the return climbs from scratch on a tiny env, and RLVR does not collapse an already-faithful model. The **objective ablation** (supervised vs. +RLVR at an interesting scale) is the open empirical follow-on (§17.4).

---

## 6. The propose–verify–correct loop (implementation)

Direct implementation of SPEC.md §5.2. The three pluggable pieces:

### 6.1 Consultation policy `π_c` (RQ2 / H2)

Decides, per step, whether to spend an oracle call, subject to budget `ρ`:

- `fixed(k)` — consult every *k* steps (baseline / dumb).
- `drift_triggered(τ)` — consult when an estimate of accumulated drift exceeds τ. (Estimate via cheap self-consistency or a learned drift predictor.)
- `uncertainty_triggered(τ)` — consult when the model's own predictive uncertainty over the delta exceeds τ (requires calibrated uncertainty; calibration is a diagnostic metric in §7).
- `learned` — a small policy trained to spend the budget where it most extends faithful horizon (stretch).

All policies are budget-normalized so comparisons in §10 are at *equal* `ρ`.

### 6.2 Correction operator `C` (RQ3 / H3)

Given a consultation returning truth `s'` and prediction `ŝ'`:

- `hard_reset` — `s ← s'` (overwrite; baseline).
- `residual` — model predicts the *correction* `s' − ŝ'`; the discrepancy is logged and (Stage 2) used as an online learning signal so the model improves from corrections.
- `projection` — project `ŝ'` onto the nearest oracle-consistent state (repair the specific edits the oracle says are wrong, keep the rest). Cheapest-faithful-horizon-per-correction candidate.

### 6.3 Loop driver

A single `Rollout` runner takes `(M_θ, O, π_c, C, ρ, ε, seed, env_config)` and produces a divergence trajectory `[d(s_t, ŝ_t)]`, the consultation schedule actually used, and `H_ε`. Everything in §10 is sweeps over this runner.

---

## 7. Metrics and instrumentation

### 7.1 Divergence `d(s, ŝ)`

Primary: **normalized symmetric difference** over the canonical state's tuple-set. Represent a state as the set `T(s) = { (path, type, content_hash, mode) }` plus scalar facts (cwd, env, last-result). Then

```
d(s, ŝ) = ( |T(s) △ T(ŝ)| + scalar_mismatches ) / ( |T(s)| + |T(ŝ)| + n_scalars )
```

`d ∈ [0,1]`, `d = 0` iff identical. Secondary/diagnostic: tree-edit distance (more structure-aware, more expensive), and per-edit precision/recall on the predicted delta.

### 7.2 Headline and supporting metrics

- **`H_ε`** — faithful horizon (SPEC.md §5.1), the headline. Swept over `ε`.
- **`H_ε(ρ)` curve** — headline result (H1). Plus the `ρ=0` floor and `ρ=1` ceiling.
- **Per-step exact-match accuracy**, **divergence-over-time curves**, **edit-level P/R** — diagnostics.
- **Uncertainty calibration** — reliability of the model's confidence vs. actual per-step divergence (needed for `uncertainty_triggered`). *Implemented:* `verisim.metrics.calibration` (Pearson/Spearman + reliability table) and the `verisim.experiments.calibration` diagnostic → `figures/calibration.*`.
- **Cost** — oracle calls per faithful step (the real currency; the point of the project is *spending oracle calls well*).

### 7.3 Instrumentation

Every rollout emits a structured run-record (JSONL) with full config, seed, the divergence trajectory, the consultation schedule, and `H_ε`. Figures are generated *only* from these records (no hand-massaged numbers), so every figure is reproducible from a run-record + a plotting script.

---

## 8. Baselines (frames the result; we are not trying to "win")

- **b0 — pure neural (`ρ=0`).** The floor: how far the learned model drifts unaided. The thing oracle-grounding is supposed to fix.
- **b1 — oracle every step (`ρ=1`).** The ceiling: perfect faithfulness, maximal cost. Defines what "close to ceiling at low budget" (H1) means. Beating b1 on fidelity is impossible by construction; that is *not* the goal.
- **b2 — symbolic-only (the oracle alone).** Included to make explicit what the neural model is *for*: cheap rollout between consultations. b2 is perfectly faithful but is just rerunning the simulator — it has no learned model and no cost savings. The neural model's value is doing the steps b2 would have to pay full price for.
- **b3 — trivial predictor** (e.g., "state unchanged" / most-frequent-delta). The absolute floor; sanity that the task is nontrivial.

The contribution is the **interior** (`0<ρ<1`) and the **policy/operator** comparisons (H2/H3), not a leaderboard win.

---

## 9. Experiment protocol

For each cell in the sweep, run `N` seeds; aggregate with bootstrap confidence intervals.

- **E1 (H1) — the curve.** Sweep `ρ ∈ {0, .05, .1, .2, .3, .5, 1}` × `ε ∈ {0, small, medium}` × difficulty ∈ {low, med, high}, policy = `fixed`. Output: `H_ε(ρ)` curves. *Decision:* does H1's "≥80% of ceiling horizon at ≤20% consultation" hold anywhere?
- **E2 (H2) — consultation policy.** Fix `ρ` at the interesting knee from E1; compare `fixed` vs `drift_triggered` vs `uncertainty_triggered` (vs `learned`, stretch) at equal `ρ`. Output: `H_ε` by policy.
- **E3 (H3) — correction operator.** Fix policy at E2's winner; compare `hard_reset` vs `residual` vs `projection`. Output: faithful-horizon-per-correction by operator; check whether `residual` reduces *future* divergence (online learning effect).
- **E4 (ablations). ✅ Model-size, difficulty, objective, and representation axes done.** Representation (delta vs full-state), model size, objective (supervised vs +RLVR), difficulty sweep, driver policy. *Implemented:* the **model-size** and **difficulty/driver** axes (`src/verisim/experiments/e4.py`, `configs/e4.json`, `figures/e4_ablation.*`), measuring clean (ρ=0) per-step teacher-forced accuracy and clean horizon. *Finding:* scaling tiny `1×32` → medium `4×128` does **not** move clean accuracy off its ≈0.1–0.2 floor (overlapping CIs), so the H1 floor is not a raw-capacity problem at this scale — training budget/difficulty co-tuning is the lever (§17.5). The **objective axis (supervised vs +RLVR) is run** (`src/verisim/experiments/objective.py`, `configs/objective.json`, `figures/objective.*`): one Stage-1 supervised model is branched into a Stage-2 RLVR copy (`train_rlvr`) and both arms are measured on the same clean (ρ=0) metrics. *Finding:* at this scale RLVR does **not** lift clean accuracy off the floor — supervised vs. +RLVR sit within overlapping CIs (high-difficulty 0.15 vs 0.13; low identical at 0.07) with clean horizon unchanged — because the faithful-horizon reward is sparse exactly when the model is at the H1 floor (episodes terminate at the first unfaithful step), so there is little signal to amplify. The **representation axis (delta vs full-state) is now run** (`src/verisim/experiments/representation.py`, `configs/representation.json`, `figures/representation.*`): a full-state head — the `StateGrammar` + `constrained_decode_state` + `FullStateWorldModel` that regenerate and constrained-decode the *whole* next state — is trained on identical data to the delta model and both are scored on the same clean (ρ=0) metrics. *Finding:* **delta dominates full-state at every cell** (clean per-step accuracy 0.07/0.15 low/high for delta vs. 0.00/0.03 for full-state; clean horizon ≥ for delta everywhere), confirming SPEC.md §6.1's prediction — regenerating the entire world is a strictly harder target than predicting the localized edits, so its faithfulness floor is even lower. This is the first E4 axis with a clear directional (non-null) result.
- **(Reserved) E5/E6** — Phase 1 system-oracle (H4) and Phase 3 counterfactuals (H5). Schemas reserved; out of v0 scope.

Each experiment maps to exactly one hypothesis and one figure. If E1 refutes H1 (linear curve), that is reported as the finding, not buried.

Keep it this size. New top-level dirs require justification against the prime directive.

---

## 11. Tech stack

- **Python 3.11+.** PyTorch for the model. Pydantic (or dataclasses) for State/Delta schemas. `pytest` for tests. `ruff` + `mypy` (strict) for hygiene. Hydra/OmegaConf (or plain dataclass configs) for the config sweeps.
- **No heavyweight framework** for the transformer in v0 — a small from-scratch implementation (nanoGPT-class) is the point and keeps it on the local GPU. HF `transformers`/`TRL` are allowed for the *optional* pretrained-baseline and for Stage-2 RLVR if hand-rolling RL proves distracting.
- **Determinism first:** seeded everything; the reference oracle is pure; torch determinism flags set for reproducible training where feasible (documented where exact reproducibility isn't achievable on GPU).
- **No telemetry, no network calls at runtime** (consistent with the author's posture across repos). Experiments run fully local or on rented GPUs the author controls.

---

## 12. Reproducibility regime

- **Everything is a function of (config + seed).** Datasets, training runs, and rollouts all regenerate from their config hash and seed. Run-records embed the full resolved config and the git commit.
- **Golden trajectories:** a small committed set of `(state, action, next_state)` goldens pins the reference-oracle semantics; CI fails on any drift (mirrors the golden-corpus discipline in the author's `enklayve` tax engine and `vaulytica`).
- **Manifest + content-hash** for datasets (regenerable, integrity-checked).
- **Figures from records only:** no figure is produced by hand; the plotting script + run-record IDs are committed next to each figure.

---

## 13. Milestones (Phase 0 / v0)

Each milestone has a concrete verify check. Gate, don't rush.

- **M0 — Env + reference oracle. ✅ Done.** Implement `State`, the §2.2 grammar, canonical serialization, and `ReferenceOracle` with full §2.3 semantics. *Verify:* golden trajectories pass; round-trip serialize/deserialize is identity; `O` is pure (property test: same input → same output, input unmutated). *Implemented in* `src/verisim/env/`, `src/verisim/oracle/`; semantics in `docs/semantics.md`; verified by `tests/test_goldens.py`, `tests/test_oracle_properties.py`, `tests/test_serialize.py`, `tests/test_action.py`.
- **M1 — Delta + apply. ✅ Done.** `Delta` types, `apply(state, Δ)`, delta↔serialization. *Verify:* for random `(s,a)`, `apply(s, oracle_delta(s,a)) == O(s,a)` (the oracle and the delta-apply agree exactly). *Implemented in* `src/verisim/delta/`; the oracle produces deltas and derives every next state via the shared `apply`, so the invariant holds by construction and is property-tested in `tests/test_oracle_properties.py`.
- **M2 — Data generation. ✅ Done.** Drivers, trajectory JSONL, versioned splits/manifests. *Verify:* dataset regenerates identically from its manifest; no trajectory leaks across splits. *Implemented in* `src/verisim/data/`; verified by `tests/test_data.py`. (The full §2.4 difficulty dial — explicit depth/breadth knobs — is deferred to M6 where it is tuned empirically; v0 difficulty is carried by the driver weighting.)
- **M3 — Divergence + faithful-horizon metrics. ✅ Done.** `d(s,ŝ)`, `H_ε`, run-record schema. *Verify:* `d=0` iff identical (property test); `H_ε` correct on hand-built diverging/non-diverging rollouts. *Implemented in* `src/verisim/metrics/`; verified by `tests/test_metrics.py`.
- **M4 — Model + supervised training (Stage 1). ✅ Done.** Tokenizer, from-scratch transformer, constrained decoder, training loop. *Verify:* model fits a tiny env (overfits a small dataset to ~0 train loss); produces only grammar-valid deltas. *Implemented in* `src/verisim/model/` (closed `Vocab`, the `tokenizer` serialization DSL, the LL(1) `DeltaGrammar` for constrained decoding, a nanoGPT-class `GPT`, the `constrained_decode`, and `NeuralWorldModel` — which implements the M5 loop's `Model` protocol so the learned model drops straight into the loop) and `src/verisim/train/` (Stage-1 supervised next-delta training). Representation decisions recorded in `docs/model-representation.md` (resolving §17 open questions #1 and #3). *Verified by* `tests/test_tokenizer.py` (encode/parse round-trip, grammar acceptance) and `tests/test_model.py` (overfits to loss < 0.05 with teacher-forced accuracy 1.0 and reproduces training deltas under constrained decode; an untrained model still decodes only grammar-valid deltas). PyTorch is an optional `[model]` extra (CPU-only in CI). Stage 2 (RLVR) is now implemented — see §5.3 (`src/verisim/train/rlvr.py`, `tests/test_rlvr.py`).
- **M5 — Propose–verify–correct loop. ✅ Done (infrastructure).** Rollout runner + `fixed` policy + `hard_reset` operator. *Verify:* `ρ=1` reproduces the oracle exactly (`H_ε = T` always); `ρ=0` matches pure-neural rollout; intermediate `ρ` runs end to end. *Implemented in* `src/verisim/loop/` (a model-agnostic `Model` protocol, the `fixed`/`never` policies §6.1, the `hard_reset` operator §6.2, and the `run_rollout` runner §6.3 that records the divergence trajectory and consultation schedule against an independent ground-truth rollout). The runner is generic over any `Model`, so the learned `M_θ` (M4) drops in unchanged. *Verified by* `tests/test_loop.py` and `tests/test_experiments.py`. The §8 baselines **b2** (`OracleBackedModel`, perfect) and **b3** (`NullModel`, trivial) are shipped now and stand in for "pure-neural" until M4 lands; a runnable sweep is in `src/verisim/experiments/baselines.py`. *Note:* the smart policies (`drift_triggered`, `uncertainty_triggered`) and the `residual`/`projection` operators are M7, not M5.
- **M6 — E1 (H1). ◐ Harness done; curve plotted; tuning ongoing.** Run the curve sweep; produce `H_ε(ρ)` figures with CIs. *Verify:* the **headline curve exists and is plotted.** ✅ The reproducible pipeline is in place: `src/verisim/experiments/e1.py` (config-driven sweep over ρ×ε×difficulty×seed through the M5 loop with the M4 neural model), `src/verisim/metrics/aggregate.py` (bootstrap-CI curve aggregation), `configs/e1.json` (the committed config), and `figures/plot_e1.py` → `figures/e1_curve.png` + `figures/e1_curve.csv`. *Verified by* `tests/test_aggregate.py`, `tests/test_e1.py`, `tests/test_plot.py`. **Finding so far (honest, not tuned):** with the small/fast committed config the curve has `H_ε≈0` at ρ=0, `H_ε=T` at ρ=1, and an interior near the floor (≈7% of ceiling at ρ=0.2) — i.e. this scale does **not** yet exhibit H1's favorable knee. Per SPEC.md §9 that is a reportable result, not a failure; getting an *interesting* interior is a model-capacity/training/difficulty tuning problem (see §17.5) and is the continuing M6 work. (A bug found by this experiment — `apply` was not total over arbitrary grammar-valid deltas — was fixed; see `tests/test_apply.py`.) **Update (2026-05): M6 closes on an *interesting* curve, not merely a plotted one — its active completion is the focused spec [SPEC-2.1 — Earning the Knee](./SPEC-2.1.md) (K0 diagnose → K1 data → K2 train → K3 difficulty → K4 re-run E1). The whole program is gated on it: no later milestone (S1 system oracle; the network/host/distributed worlds) is built until SPEC-2.1 yields a knee or the honest negative that licenses moving on.**
- **M7 — Policies + operators (E2/E3, H2/H3). ✅ Done.** Added `drift_triggered`, `uncertainty_triggered` (§6.1) and `residual`, `projection` (§6.2); ran E2/E3. *Verify:* equal-budget comparisons produced with CIs. ✅ *Implemented in* `src/verisim/loop/policy.py` (the `StepContext` a policy sees, plus `UncertaintyTriggered`/`DriftTriggered` thresholding the model's instantaneous / accumulated uncertainty), `src/verisim/loop/operator.py` (`Residual`/`Projection`), `src/verisim/loop/runner.py` (threads the per-step uncertainty signal and adds a **spend-down backstop** so *every* policy spends exactly `floor(ρ·T)` calls — true equal-`ρ`, §16), `src/verisim/model/decode.py` + `world_model.py` (the neural `M_θ` exposes mean decode entropy as its uncertainty signal, making it a `loop.UncertaintyModel`), and `src/verisim/experiments/e2.py` / `e3.py` (config-driven comparisons; `configs/e2.json`, `configs/e3.json`; `verisim.metrics.aggregate.aggregate_comparison` for the equal-budget CIs; `figures/plot_comparison.py` → `figures/e2_policies.*`, `figures/e3_operators.*`). *Verified by* `tests/test_loop.py` (triggered-policy firing, operator identity + diagnostics, spend-down, equal-budget), `tests/test_aggregate.py`, `tests/test_e2.py`, `tests/test_e3.py`, `tests/test_plot.py`. **Findings (honest, not tuned):** *E2 (H2)* — at equal budget the dumb `fixed` policy (`H_ε≈1.4`) *beats* both triggered policies (`uncertainty≈0.6`, `drift≈0.1`); the small model's decode-entropy uncertainty is not yet calibrated enough to beat even-spacing, so calibration (§17.2) is the next lever. *E3 (H3)* — all three operators give an **identical** `H_ε` with identical CIs, the expected v0 identity: with a full-state one-step oracle truth every operator corrects to the same `s'`, so they differ only in the diagnostic they expose (residual's online-learning signal magnitude; projection's per-correction repair cost). H3's horizon differences need partial verification or Stage-2 online learning (deferred).
- **M8 — Write-up + packaging. ◐ Core shipped; external publication open.** Short technical report (honest negative results); package the env+metric as an Inspect eval and a Prime Intellect environment (§15). *Verify:* a stranger can reproduce a figure from configs+seeds. ✅ *Implemented:* the report in [`docs/report.md`](./docs/report.md) (the E1/E2/E3 figures + the honest H1/H2/H3 negatives, every number read from a committed CSV); the missing §10 docs [`docs/related-work.md`](./docs/related-work.md) and [`docs/lineage.md`](./docs/lineage.md); the **faithfulness benchmark** `src/verisim/eval/` (dependency-free `score_model`/`DEFAULT_SUITE` over any loop `Model`, single-step labels + divergence grader, and an `inspect_ai` task adapter behind the optional `[eval]` extra); the **oracle-as-reward RL environment** `src/verisim/rl/` (`WorldModelEnv` + the `load_environment` entrypoint — a `verifiers`-spec env whose episode return equals the faithful horizon, dependency-free); and `figures/reproduce.sh`, which regenerates every figure from configs+seeds (the *Verify* criterion). *Verified by* `tests/test_eval.py`, `tests/test_rl.py`, and the existing determinism tests. **Open (out of repo / future):** the literal arXiv submission and the Inspect/Prime-Intellect hub *uploads* are external publication acts, not code. (The E4 size/difficulty ablation, the §7.2 calibration diagnostic, the E4 objective axis (supervised vs +RLVR), and the E4 representation axis (delta vs full-state) have since been added, so the report now covers seven figures.)

M0–M6 is the minimum that constitutes a result. M7–M8 is the depth and the distribution.

## 14. Forward interfaces (the only future-proofing v0 builds)

To make later phases additive rather than rewrites, v0 commits to exactly two abstractions and no more:

- **`Oracle` protocol (§3.2)** — so `SandboxOracle` (Phase 1, real shell) and future network/syscall oracles drop in unchanged.
- **`Environment` boundary** — `State`/`Action`/`Delta`/serialization behind a small interface, so Phase 4's network state is a new `Environment` implementation, not a fork.

(A third seam, the **`Model` protocol** of M5/§6.3, already exists and is load-bearing *now*, not future-proofing: the loop is generic over any proposer, so the from-scratch transformer, the oracle-backed baseline, and — later — a JEPA-style latent model or an LLM-as-proposer all drop in unchanged. This is what makes Verisim's most general claim — that the favorable-consultation behavior belongs to the oracle-loop, not the model class — *testable* rather than asserted: SPEC.md §6 commitment 4 and hypothesis H22.)

Everything else (partial observability, counterfactual harness, agent training) is explicitly deferred and must not add abstraction weight to v0.

## 15. Packaging for the research ecosystems

When M6 produces a curve, the artifact is published where researchers already look (SPEC.md §14):

- **arXiv / technical report** — the `H_ε(ρ)` result, policy/operator comparisons, honest negatives.
- **Inspect eval** — package the faithfulness benchmark (env + divergence + ground-truth labels) as an `inspect_evals`-compatible task, so it slots into the framework labs already use for evaluations.
- **Prime Intellect environment** — wrap the env + oracle-as-reward as a `verifiers`-spec RL environment on the Environments Hub, making "train a world model against a verifiable oracle reward" a reusable community artifact. This is also the cleanest public expression of the author's verifier-as-reward thesis.
- **MIT license + responsible-use README** — per SPEC.md §13 ethics (defensive framing; review before releasing anything encoding real exploit dynamics).

---

## 16. Testing strategy

- **Semantics goldens** — committed `(s, a, s')` cases pin the reference oracle; CI fails on drift (§12).
- **Property tests** — oracle purity/determinism; `d=0 ⇔ identical`; `apply∘oracle_delta == oracle`; serialize round-trip identity; grammar-validity of all decoded deltas.
- **Loop invariants** — `ρ=1 ⇒ H_ε=T`; `ρ=0 ⇒` matches unaided neural rollout; consultation budget never exceeded.
- **Metric tests** — `H_ε` on hand-built rollouts with known horizons.
- **Reproducibility test** — a run reproduces bit-for-bit from (config, seed) where determinism is claimed; documented exceptions where GPU nondeterminism prevents it.

Tests are not optional polish here — they are the thing that makes the eventual claims *trustworthy*, which for a project whose entire thesis is "deterministic verification" is the point.

## 17. Open engineering questions (to resolve during M0–M4)

These are known unknowns; record decisions in `docs/` as they're made.

1. **Content modeling. ✅ Resolved (M4).** Fixed content-token vocab (chosen for v0) vs. eventually real byte content. v0 fixes it: content is a string over a **prefix-free** content vocabulary, so it decomposes uniquely by greedy longest-match. Boundary to real byte content noted. See `docs/model-representation.md`.
2. **Uncertainty estimation. ◑ Decided + measured (M7/diagnostic); recalibration open.** The `uncertainty_triggered` / `drift_triggered` policies are driven by the **mean Shannon entropy of the constrained decode** — the per-step spread of probability over the grammar-valid next tokens — exposed by `NeuralWorldModel.predict_delta_with_uncertainty` (`uncertainty` thresholds the instantaneous value; `drift` thresholds its running sum since the last consult, a cheap oracle-free proxy for compounding drift). This was chosen over ensemble disagreement (too expensive for a single local model) and a learned drift head (extra training surface) as the cheapest signal that needs no second model. The **§7.2 calibration diagnostic now measures it directly** (`src/verisim/metrics/calibration.py`, `src/verisim/experiments/calibration.py`, `figures/calibration.*`): at the small committed scale the decode entropy correlates only weakly with actual per-step divergence (Pearson ≈ 0.11, Spearman ≈ 0.18; a near-flat reliability curve), which is *why* E2's triggered policies cannot beat even-spacing. **Open:** make the signal informative — recalibrate decode entropy, or revisit ensemble/learned-head signals, at larger scale; the diagnostic is now the measurable target.
3. **Tokenization of paths/trees. ✅ Resolved (M4).** Segment tokenizer vs. structural/graph encoding of the FS tree. v0 uses the **serialized-DSL + segment tokenizer** (absolute paths as `<p>`-delimited name segments); structural/graph encoding revisited only if structure proves hard to learn. See `docs/model-representation.md`.
4. **RLVR stability (Stage 2). ◐ Machinery shipped; scale-tuning + ablation open.** Hand-rolled vs. TRL; reward shaping for faithful-horizon. The mechanism is built (`src/verisim/train/rlvr.py`): hand-rolled REINFORCE with a moving-average baseline against the oracle faithful-horizon reward, no TRL dependency — grammar-constrained sampling supplies the per-token log-probs the policy gradient needs. Verified to learn from scratch and to not collapse a faithful model on a tiny env (`tests/test_rlvr.py`). The supervised-vs-+RLVR **objective ablation** (the E4 axis, §9) is now **run** (`src/verisim/experiments/objective.py`): at the small committed scale RLVR is an honest null — clean accuracy and horizon are within overlapping CIs of supervised, because the faithful-horizon reward is sparse exactly when the model sits at the H1 floor. **Open:** reward-shaping / variance and re-running the ablation once difficulty co-tuning (§17.5) gives the model a non-trivial horizon to extend (where RLVR has signal to amplify).
5. **Difficulty calibration. ◐ In progress (M6); E4 narrows it.** What difficulty setting makes `ρ=0` drift within tested horizons *without* being pathological? Tuned empirically at M6 (the curve must have room to be interesting). The E1 harness exists; with the current small config the model is too weak to predict even step 0 reliably (`ρ=0` drifts immediately, interior near the floor). **E4 (§9) rules out raw model size as the fix** — scaling 4× does not move clean per-step accuracy off its ≈0.1–0.2 floor — so the remaining levers are training budget / dataset size and difficulty, co-tuned until the interior `0<ρ<1` becomes informative. This is the open empirical work that turns "the curve is plotted" into "H1 is tested." **This co-tuning is now automated** as an autoresearch-style ratchet (`src/verisim/auto/search.py`, `configs/auto.json`, `figures/auto_search.*`): a deterministic *keep-if-better* search over the §17.5 levers (model size, train iters, dataset size, lr), gated on an **oracle-grounded** score — mean clean (ρ=0) per-step accuracy against the oracle's true next state, verisim's single comparable scalar (its "val_bpb"). After Karpathy's [`autoresearch`](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), but with reality (the oracle), not held-out loss, as the "did we improve?" gate. *First run (12 trials):* the ratchet autonomously more than doubled the clean floor (0.042 → 0.094) by finding `train_iters↑` then `lr↑`, then held through the rejected trials — the mechanism lifts the metric against ground truth even while the absolute level stays floor-level at this scale. The proposer is seeded coordinate hill-climbing today; an LLM-agent proposer is the natural next layer behind the same gate.

*This document is the v0 contract. When a milestone completes, mark it and link its run-records and figures here. When an open question (§17) is resolved, record the decision in `docs/` and reference it. Keep v0 small; the science is one curve. Build the rest only after the curve exists.*
